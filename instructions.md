 1. Check that your kit has all the proper frame bars & connectors. See **BOM-Master's STR-BAR-PCK-0001** tab for a list of bars. See **BOM-Master's "Kit Stage 1 BOM"** to find the connectors- STR-CON-0001, STR-CON-0002, STR-CON-0003.
 2.  Set the baseplate to the side for now, and group the bars by length
 
#### Base Layer
  
1. Collect the Base Layer Components:
  * x2 of STR-BAR-0001
  * x1 of STR-BAR-0003
  * x1 of STR-BAR-0004
  * x1 of STR-BAR-0005
  * x1 of STR-BAR-0006
  * x1 of STR-BAR-0007
  * x1 of STR-BAR-0008
  * x4 of STR-CON-0001
  * x3 of STR-CON-0002
  * x2 of STR-CON-0003

2. In x1 **STR-BAR-0001** bar, Insert x2 of **STR-CON-0001**. In The other **STR-BAR-0001**, insert x1 **STR-CON-0001** and x1 **STR-CON-0002**. Wider hole spacing should be through the vertical surface, as shown. These bars run along the bottom side of the grow chamber.

3. Lay down one **STR-BAR-0003** in back, and one **STR-BAR-0008** in front. The wider hole spacing on **STR-BAR-0003** should be on the vertical surface. Make sure the 4-way connnector STR-CON-0002 is in the far left corner. Some *light* force may be required here. Set This Assembly to the side

![Grow Chamber portion of bottom layer.](Frame Build Photos/Bottom Layer Half 1.jpg)
 
4. Gather x1 of: **STR-BAR-0004**, **STR-BAR-0005**, **STR-BAR-0006**, **STR-BAR-0007**.
5. Connect x1 of **STR-CON-0001**  and x1 of **STR-CON-0002** into **STR-BAR-0005**, in orientation shown below. 
6. Connect **STR-BAR-0004** onto the 3-way connector, wider hole spacing vertical on the vertical surface, **STR-BAR-0007** perpendicular on the 4-way connector, and **STR-BAR-0006** parallel, with holes oriented as shown. 

![Electric Box Portion of Bottom Layer.](photos/Frame Build Photos/Bottom Layer 3.jpg)

7. Insert x1 **STR-CON-0003** into the end of **STR-BAR-0007** & **STR-BAR-0006**. 
8. Double check all bar orientations, then attach the two assemblies together. 

#### Top Layer

1. In x1 **STR-BAR-0001** bar, Insert x2 of **STR-CON-0001**. In The other **STR-BAR-0001**, insert x2 **STR-CON-0002** and x1 **STR-CON-0002**. Wider hole spacing should be through the vertical surface, as shown. These bars run along the top side of the grow chamber.

![Top Side Bars of Growing Chamber](photos/Frame Build Photos/Top Layer 1.jpg)

2. Lay down one **STR-BAR-0003** in back, and one **STR-BAR-0008** in front. Again, the wider hole spacing on **STR-BAR-0003** should be Through the verical surface. Some *light* force may be necessary here.

![Growing Chamber Half of Top Layer](photos/Frame Build Photos/Top Layer 13.jpg)

3. Gather x2 of **STR-BAR-0004**, x1 of **STR-BAR-0005**, x1 of **STR-BAR-0006**, x1 of **STR-BAR-0007**, x2 of **STR-CON-0001**, x1 of **STR-CON-0002**, x1 of **STR-CON-0003**.
4. Connect x1 **STR-CON-0001**  and x1 **STR-CON-0002** into **STR-BAR-0005**, in orientation shown. 
5. Connect **STR-BAR-0004** onto the 3-way connector with holes oriented as shown, **STR-BAR-0007** perpendicular on the 4-way connector, and **STR-BAR-0006** parallel, with holes oriented as shown. ![Pic]
6. Inert x1 **STR-CON-0003** in the end of **STR-BAR-0007** with the exposed end downward, x1 **STR-CON-0001** similarly into **STR-BAR-0006**. 
7. Connect the final **STR-BAR-0004** horizontally on the 3 way connector. Centered thread through the outer vertical surface.

![Electric Box Portion of Top Layer](photos/Frame Build Photos/Top Layer 8.jpg)

8. Put last connectors in *(is this step needed)*
9. check orientations, attach halves.

### Mounting Vertical Members
1. There are three vertical members: **STR-BAR-0002**, **STR-BAR-0009** & **STR-BAR-0010**
 * Refering to **BOM-Master's STR-BAR-PCK-0001**, 
  * **STR-BAR-0010** has L-brackets attached to it, with two larger holes on the bottom. 
  * **STR-BAR-0009** has 10 holes, including Threads for the door attachement
  * **STR-BAR-0002** has 16 holes, and stands in the Rear of the growing chamber. 
2. Attach all **STR-BAR-0010** to the Electronics Box side- the smaller bottom half. 
3. Attach both **STR-BAR-0002** to the back two connectors of the growing chamber, wider hole spacing towar back. 
4. attach both **STR-BAR-0009** to the front two connectors, threaded holes facing outward.
